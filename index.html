            <h4>Full Stack Developer!</h4>
            <p>"I am currently pursuing my Bachelor's degree in Management Information Systems (MIS), where I am
                learning how technology supports and drives business operations. Through my coursework, I have gained
                foundational knowledge in database management, systems analysis, information security, and enterprise
                applications. However, my true passion lies in software development—specifically in becoming a
                Full-Stack Developer. I am fascinated by how front-end and back-end technologies work together to create
                powerful web applications. I have started learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for front-end development,
                and I am also exploring backend technologies such as Node.js and Express.js. I am working on improving
                my skills in database management using tools like MongoDB and MySQL. I enjoy solving problems through
                code and find great satisfaction in building interactive and responsive websites. As a tech enthusiast,
                I am constantly looking for new ways to grow, whether through online courses, coding challenges, or
                real-world projects. My goal is to develop the ability to build scalable and efficient full-stack
                applications that can make a positive impact. I believe my background in MIS gives me a unique
                perspective on how to integrate business needs with technology solutions. I am also focusing on
                improving my skills in version control (Git and GitHub) and UI/UX design. In the future, I aim to work
                in a collaborative environment where I can contribute to impactful software projects. I am committed to
                lifelong learning and excited about the opportunities the world of Full-Stack Development has to offer.
                I see this path not just as a career, but as a journey to create, innovate, and inspire
                through technology."</p>

                        <h2>UI/UX Design</h2>
                        <p>UX (User Experience) and UI (User Interface) are two essential aspects of modern digital
                            product design. UX focuses on how users interact with a product, aiming to provide smooth,
                            efficient, and meaningful experiences. It involves user research, wireframing, and testing
                            to understand user needs and behaviors. On the other hand, UI is all about the look and feel
                            of a product—the visual elements like buttons, colors, typography, and layout that users
                            interact with. While UX is about solving user problems, UI ensures the design is attractive
                            and intuitive. Both UX and UI must work together to create successful websites and
                            applications that users enjoy using. In short, UX is the experience, and UI is the
                            appearance—but both are equally important in creating great digital solutions.</p>

                        <h2>Website development</h2>
                        <p>Website development is the process of creating and maintaining websites for the internet or
                            an intranet. It involves several aspects, including web design, front-end and back-end
                            development, content creation, and website performance optimization. Front-end development
                            focuses on what users see and interact with, using technologies like HTML, CSS, and
                            JavaScript. Back-end development deals with server-side logic, databases, and application
                            functionality using languages such as PHP, Python, or Node.js. A good website must be
                            user-friendly, responsive, fast, and secure. Developers often use content management systems
                            (CMS) like WordPress, or frameworks like React and Django to build modern websites. Website
                            development plays a key role in business growth, online branding, and digital communication
                            in today's world.</p>

                        <h2>Software development</h2>
                        <p>Software development is the process of designing, building, testing, and maintaining software
                            applications to solve real-world problems or enhance digital experiences. It includes
                            several stages, such as requirement analysis, planning, coding, debugging, deployment, and
                            ongoing maintenance. Developers use various programming languages like Python, JavaScript,
                            Java, and C++ depending on the project's needs. In addition to coding skills, a good
                            software developer must have strong problem-solving ability, logical thinking, and teamwork
                            skills. Modern software development often follows Agile or Scrum methodologies to ensure
                            faster delivery and continuous improvement. Tools like Git and GitHub are used to manage
                            source code and collaborate with team members efficiently. As technology evolves, software
                            development continues to play a vital role in shaping industries, automation, and
                            our everyday lives.</p>
